/// A common base class for Text displays
/// To port a new display, derive from this class and implement
/// the constructor (setup the display), character (put a character
/// at a location), rows and columns (number of rows/cols) functions.
/// Everything else (locate, printf, putc, cls) will come for free
///
/// The model is the display will wrap at the right and bottom, so you can
/// keep writing and will always get valid characters. The location is
/// maintained internally to the class to make this easy
